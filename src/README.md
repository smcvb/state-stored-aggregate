# State-Stored Aggregate

This sample project aims to show what a State-Stored Aggregate could look like in an [Axon](https://www.axoniq.io) based application.
The approach is based on what's provided in Axon's [Reference Guide](https://docs.axoniq.io/reference-guide/implementing-domain-logic/command-handling/state-stored-aggregates) on the matter.
